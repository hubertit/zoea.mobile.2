## Summary

### ✅ What Works:
- Backend APIs exist for all features
- Merchant portal exists for listings/bookings
- Admin portal exists for general management

### ❌ What's Missing:
1. **Merchant Portal**: Products, Services, Menus, Orders, Shop Settings management
2. **Tour Operators**: No portal exists at all
3. **Authorization**: Backend APIs don't verify ownership
4. **UI**: No management interfaces for shop features

### 🎯 Recommendation:
1. **Immediate**: Add Products/Services/Menus/Orders management to merchant portal
2. **Short-term**: Add authorization checks to backend APIs
3. **Medium-term**: Create tour operator portal or add tour operator section to admin portal
4. **Long-term**: Add analytics, reporting, and advanced features
